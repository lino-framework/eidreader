=========================
The ``eidreader`` script
=========================


eidreader is a command-line script that reads data from Belgian eID cards and
writes the data to stdout or posts it to a web server. It is designed to be used
together with a web application that will process the data.

Not to be mixed up with its deprecated Java predecessor `eidreader
<https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader>`__ (same project name but
another account).

- The central project homepage is https://eidreader.lino-framework.org
- Please report issues to https://github.com/lino-framework/eidreader/issues

This script was written and is maintained by Luc Saffre <luc@saffre-rumma.net>.
